SF Test Copy
==========
This is my first ever python application so its definitely not written in the best way, but you have to start somewhere!

Because this is the first app I have written there is a lot of bits that dont really seem like they are needed, I added them so I could learn a bit.

Basically all this app does is search for classes that contain testMethod and copy them to a new dir with package.xm and build.xml so that you can run them on SF. If you have managed packages and use runAllTests it will report errors back to Jenkins, which is annoying.

Not finished. Still adding random bits.
